## Building the Support Vector Regression Model

### Dataset
The position is encoded to numbers in the level column, hence we will not be applying OneHotEncoder method

_Data Source: SuperDataScience Dataset_

## Python codes for Support Vector Regression (SVR)
---

## Importing the libraries
```python
prrint(x)
```

## Importing the dataset
```python
prrint(x)
```

## Print (X)
```python
prrint(x)
```

## Print (y)
```python
prrint(y)

# Reshape y to appear vertically as default comes horizontally
y = y.reshape(len(y),1)
```

## Feature Scaling
_In case a column has a value of 0 and 1, no need to apply feature scaling in that column because it is already in the range of 0 and 1 that feature scaling is trying to achieve._
```python
prrint(x)
```

## Print (X)
```python
prrint(x)
```

## Print (y)
```python
prrint(y)
```

## Training the SVR model on the whole dataset
```python
prrint(y)
```

## Predicting a new result
```python
prrint(y)
```

## Visualising the SVR results
```python
prrint(y)
```
